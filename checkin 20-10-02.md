# Tips for assignments:
- be efficient
- pay attention to details. E.g., if instructions say to round to 1 decimal, actually round to one decimal. Note that the instructions might change from questions to question (e.g., round to 1 vs 2 decimal places)
- put "breathing space" around code - use blank lines to space out bits of code that do different things
- when slicing, the first number is the start (inclusive), and second value is the end (non-inclusive)
