Hi there - you’re receiving this because you’re registered for NESC or PSYO 3505, Neural Data Science, for fall term. This is your welcome/orientation email.

This class will be run online (obviously) and largely asynchronously (i.e., there are no mandatory class times when everyone has to connect by video chat; though there will be optional times every week to connect with me and the TA via video chat - essentially online office hours and demonstrations by the teaching team. As well, I’ve designed it from the ground up as an online class, following best practices for online teaching, and integrating some fun and innovative ideas. This means that although existing skills you have already developed to succeed in university (like time management and study skills) will be important, some things will be new and/or different. As well, the online platforms probably all be new to you. Most importantly to know is that this course does not use Brightspace - instead it uses Microsoft Teams as its primary web portal/learning management system.

So, to get you started, check out the course web page at https://bit.ly/nesc3505. This has the syllabus, schedule, and a link to the textbook.
 The textbook for this class is online, written by me (nothing for you to pay for for this class, other than tuition!). The first two chapters are an introduction to the class, the mindset you should bring to it, and the technology we’ll be using. You should read the first chapter by the first day of the class (Sept 8), and ideally the second chapter too (definitely aim to have read both chapters by Sept 9).

By the first day of class, you will receive email invitations to the course “tech” platforms: Teams, DataCamp, and CoCalc. You’ll learn more about these in the textbook.

On Wednesday, Sept. 9 at 2 PM I will host a live introductory session on MS Teams. Please join if you’re able. If not, I will record the session and you can view it later. During the session I’ll provide an orientation to the class, and answer any questions. Future live meetings (again, optional, and more like open office hours) will be determined based on a poll I’ll put on Teams, taking into account the time zones and availability of registered students.

Please let me know by email if you have any questions, otherwise I’ll connect with you again next week!
